        <h2>Server Build 2021</h2>
        <p class="languages"><span>Languages:</span> Hardware + Debian Linux</p>
        <p>
            Worked with a budget to buy specific components for a Dell R720 (2012) enterprise server. Allocated
            memory for a
            triple channel configuration. Flashed the EEPROM propeitary
            Dell PERC (PowerEdge Raid Card) into HBA (Host Bus Adaptor) mode for direct drive passthrough to the
            Kernel. Acquired eight 4tb Seagate Iron Wolf
            Harddrives to test hardware raid configurgations and Zettabyte File System (ZFS) software raid
            configurations. Installed Proxmox Hypervisor to manage and allocate system resources to virtual
            machines.

        <h2>Server Build 2024</h2>
        <p class="languages"><span>Languages:</span> Hardware + Debian Linux</p>
        <p>
            After the server build died (motherboard trace broken), I looked at using my up to date specifications
            for my next server. Examined
            the used computer component markets for consumer hardware with enterprise features like: motherboard ecc
            support, high capcity ECC DRAM, 10GiB/Dual NIC, High threaded CPU, high Efficiency/Reliable PSU, 8x 3.5"
            internal drive bays,
            dedicated video transcoding GPU.

        <h2>Windows Deployment Services (WDS) / Active Directory homelab</h2>
        <p class="languages"><span>Languages:</span> Hardware</p>
        <p>
            Created a Windows Server 2022 virutal machine to use as a domain controller and deployment server. Then
            setup serveral virtual machines to PXE boot to the deployment server to install windows.
            Enacted group policy for automatted software installations and limit user access.

        <h2>Configure Fortinet 40f Firewall</h2>
        <p class="languages"><span>Languages:</span> Hardware</p>
        <p>
            Integrated a hardware firewall within my home network. The firewall enabled deep packet inspection and
            intrusion prevention system by having devices sign on packets sent and recieved. By installing radius
            server on my domain controller, We can directly integrate active directory user certificates to network
            traffic.
